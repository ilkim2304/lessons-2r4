        The GeForce RTX 2060 is a performance-segment graphics card by NVIDIA, launched in January 2019. Built on the 12 nm process, and based on the TU106 graphics processor, in its TU106-200A-KA-A1 variant, the card supports DirectX 12 Ultimate. This ensures that all modern games will run on GeForce RTX 2060. Additionally, the DirectX 12 Ultimate capability guarantees support for hardware-raytracing, variable-rate shading and more, in upcoming video games. The TU106 graphics processor is a large chip with a die area of 445 mm² and 10,800 million transistors. Unlike the fully unlocked GeForce RTX 2070, which uses the same GPU but has all 2304 shaders enabled, NVIDIA has disabled some shading units on the GeForce RTX 2060 to reach the product's target shader count. It features 1920 shading units, 120 texture mapping units, and 48 ROPs. Also included are 240 tensor cores which help improve the speed of machine learning applications. The card also has 30 raytracing acceleration cores. NVIDIA has paired 6 GB GDDR6 memory with the GeForce RTX 2060, which are connected using a 192-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 1365 MHz, which can be boosted up to 1680 MHz, memory is running at 1750 MHz (14 Gbps effective).
        Being a dual-slot card, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 draws power from 1x 8-pin power connector, with power draw rated at 160 W maximum. Display outputs include: 1x DVI, 1x HDMI, 2x DisplayPort, 1x USB Type-C. GeForce RTX 2060 is connected to the rest of the system using a PCI-Express 3.0 x16 interface. The card's dimensions are 229 mm x 113 mm x 35 mm, and it features a dual-slot cooling solution.

Built on the 8 nm process, and based on the GA102 graphics processor, in its GA102-200-KD-A1 variant, the card supports DirectX 12 Ultimate. This ensures that all modern games will run on GeForce RTX 3080. Additionally, the DirectX 12 Ultimate capability guarantees support for hardware-raytracing, variable-rate shading and more, in upcoming video games. The GA102 graphics processor is a large chip with a die area of 628 mm² and 28,300 million transistors. Unlike the fully unlocked GeForce RTX 3090, which uses the same GPU but has all 10496 shaders enabled, NVIDIA has disabled some shading units on the GeForce RTX 3080 to reach the product's target shader count. It features 8704 shading units, 272 texture mapping units, and 96 ROPs. Also included are 272 tensor cores which help improve the speed of machine learning applications. The card also has 68 raytracing acceleration cores. NVIDIA has paired 10 GB GDDR6X memory with the GeForce RTX 3080, which are connected using a 320-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 1440 MHz, which can be boosted up to 1710 MHz, memory is running at 1188 MHz (19 Gbps effective).
        Being a dual-slot card, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 draws power from 1x 12-pin power connector, with power draw rated at 320 W maximum. Display outputs include: 1x HDMI, 3x DisplayPort. GeForce RTX 3080 is connected to the rest of the system using a PCI-Express 4.0 x16 interface. The card measures 285 mm in length, 112 mm in width, and features a dual-slot cooling solution.
