        The Radeon RX Vega 56 is a high-end graphics card by AMD, launched in August 2017. Built on the 14 nm process, and based on the Vega 10 graphics processor, in its Vega 10 XL variant, the card supports DirectX 12. This ensures that all modern games will run on Radeon RX Vega 56. The Vega 10 graphics processor is a large chip with a die area of 495 mm² and 12,500 million transistors. Unlike the fully unlocked Radeon RX Vega 64, which uses the same GPU but has all 4096 shaders enabled, AMD has disabled some shading units on the Radeon RX Vega 56 to reach the product's target shader count. It features 3584 shading units, 224 texture mapping units, and 64 ROPs. AMD has paired 8 GB HBM2 memory with the Radeon RX Vega 56, which are connected using a 2048-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 1156 MHz, which can be boosted up to 1471 MHz, memory is running at 800 MHz.
        Being a dual-slot card, the AMD Radeon RX Vega 56 draws power from 2x 8-pin power connectors, with power draw rated at 210 W maximum. Display outputs include: 1x HDMI, 3x DisplayPort. Radeon RX Vega 56 is connected to the rest of the system using a PCI-Express 3.0 x16 interface. The card's dimensions are 280 mm x 111 mm x 40 mm, and it features a dual-slot cooling solution.
